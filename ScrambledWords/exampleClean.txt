Sample to scramble. the psycological "super-ego" is the part of the psyche that is responsible for conforming with the social standards. Do not commit crimes; be part of the group - that is the super-ego's job. However, ID is the oposite of super-ego. ID is the part of the psyche that seeks instant gratification. Be it sex or a stolen item - that's what ID is interested in. 
But is one able to balance the two? Ego - the non-extremist part of our psyche is there to balance the actions of these conflicting opposites existing withen every one of us.
